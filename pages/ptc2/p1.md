Contest info:

- 6-9 problems
- 3 hours to solve
- Approximately Div. 2 difficulty


## Problem A

> Water problem

> Estimated difficulty: ||800||

### Description

You have $n$ puddings, the $i^\mathrm{th}$ of which has deliciousness $d_i$. You can eat at most $m$ of the puddings.
After eating some (possibly zero) puddings, your happiness value becomes the sum of their deliciousness.
Find the maximum happiness value you can get.

### Constraints

- $1 \le m \le n \le 10^5$
- $-10^9 \le d_i \le 10^9$


## Problem C

> Water problem

> Estimated difficulty: ||1200||

### Description


### Constraints



## Problem D

> Classical, easy

> Estimated difficulty: ||1400||

### Description

You are given an array $a = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ of $n$ integers.
Let $f(k)$ be the median of the subarray $[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k]$.
For each $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$, find $f(i)$.

### Constraints

- $ 1 \le n \le 3 \times 10^5 $
- $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 $


## Problem G

> Bad problem, obvious, **not tested**

> Estimated difficulty: ||2300||

### Description

You are given a set $S=\\{S_1,S_2,\dots,S_n\\}$ of $n$ integers. Each integer $S_i$ has a positive integer weight $w_i$.

Find a subset $T=\\{T_1,T_2,\dots,T_k\\}\subseteq S$ such that the total weight of $T$'s elements is maximized, and
there is a prime number $p$ such that $T_1\equiv T_2\equiv \dots \equiv T_k \pmod p$.

### Constraints

- $2 \le n \le 10^5$
- $1 \le S_i \le 10^9$
- $1 \le w_i \le 10^4$
